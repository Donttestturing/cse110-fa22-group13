2) Primary Means of Communication and Expectations

Our primary means of communication is through Slack, supplementarily using Discord for remote meetings. Responses will be expected as some form of response (be it emoji reaction, text response, some form of confirmation), within 24 hours of a notice being sent. 

3) Scheduling Meetings (Schedule at least one meeting as part of constructing your team agreement.)

Meetings will be initally scheduled after a when2meet is filled out by each group member (response time for when2meet should be 24 hours), after which we should have a set time and date for the meeting to take place. Reminders of the meeting will be sent out as an announcement in Slack. Meeting attendence will be recorded in the meeting notes.
Additional meetings with our TA will take place at 4pm on Mondays where team members are free to attend optionally.
