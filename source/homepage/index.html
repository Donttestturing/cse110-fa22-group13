              <h1>John Grisham returns to Mississippi with the riveting story of two sons of
                immigrant families who grow up as friends, but ultimately find themselves on
                opposite sides of the law. Grisham’s trademark twists and turns will keep you
                tearing through the pages until the stunning conclusion.
                
                
                For most of the last hundred years, Biloxi was known for its beaches, resorts, and
                seafood industry. But it had a darker side. It was also notorious for corruption and
                vice, everything from gambling, prostitution, bootleg liquor, and drugs to contract
                killings. The vice was controlled by small cabal of mobsters, many of them
                rumored to be members of the Dixie Mafia.</h1>

              <h1>By age thirty, Stephanie Foo was successful on paper: She had her dream job as
                an award-winning radio producer at This American Life and a loving boyfriend. But
                behind her office door, she was having panic attacks and sobbing at her desk
                every morning. After years of questioning what was wrong with herself, she was
                diagnosed with complex PTSD—a condition that occurs when trauma happens
                continuously, over the course of years.
                
                Both of Foo’s parents abandoned her when she was a teenager, after years of
                physical and verbal abuse and neglect. She thought she’d moved on, but her new
                diagnosis illuminated the way her past continued to threaten her health,
                relationships, and career. She found limited resources to help her, so Foo set out</h1>
