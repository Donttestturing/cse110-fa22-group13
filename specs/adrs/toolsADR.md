# Essential Tools for Developing the Project

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to decide which tools we will use to develop our project. 


## Considered Options

* Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* No backend, no databases, no NODEJS as individual server
* Storage-> local storage - browser tools cashing
* Back-end: (NO BACKEND)
    * __JavaScript__
        * Fetch API for webscraping?
        * Local (user machine) 
* Version Control: GitHub
* Hosting: Hosted Locally
* UI Design: Figma
* Communication: Slack
* Planning: Miro
* Application type: CRUD Web App
* Diagramming: With draw.io vscode extension 
* (need to research) Framework: Possibly make our webapp as a binary in _electron_? 
    * Put together a small team to look into electron

* NO FRAMEWORKS ALLOWED --> Packager instead 

## Decision Outcome

* Decisions are made with the priority of the local first system in mind.
* Stick with JS for backend
    * A bit unsure if we can even use other languages for backend.
* Data Storage is still a little unsure.
    * Decide in future
* Not using docker, local hosting
    * Potentially use server in future
* Electron or Electron alternative would be preferred to use as a framework. 

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Electron
    * Pro: Useful framework considering we're using local first. It wraps it in a binary (turns website into an executable). 
    * Con: Wil make the project heavier, can take time for our group to understand
